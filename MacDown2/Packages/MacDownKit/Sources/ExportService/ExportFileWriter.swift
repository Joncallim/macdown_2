/// durability (issue #49).
///
/// Ownership contract:
/// - The companion directory is exactly `prepared.assetsDirectoryName` — the
///   primary file's own basename — next to the primary file; callers cannot
///   redirect it, and two documents exported into the same folder never share
///   one, so exporting one document can never overwrite or expose another's
///   companions.
/// - A versioned marker (`<name>.assets/.macdown-export-marker`) is written
///   before any resource is written, establishing the reserved namespace.
/// - Only the reserved namespace is mutated: the marker, `.tmp` scratch files,
///   and content-addressed `<64hex>.<ext>` resources (images and, for linked
///   CSS, the stylesheet itself). Non-reserved user files are never deleted or
///   overwritten.
///
/// Durability contract:
/// - Required resources are written before the primary HTML is atomically
///   promoted, so the HTML never appears before its assets do.
/// - There is no claim of multi-file atomicity; each file is written atomically
///   on its own.
