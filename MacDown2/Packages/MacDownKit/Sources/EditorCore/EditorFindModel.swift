/// Pure find/navigate state for the current-document Find bar. Kept free of
/// any AppKit/SwiftUI/`NSTextView` knowledge so it is directly testable
/// without presenting UI, matching `CommandPaletteModel`'s own established
/// convention for a live, `@Observable` SwiftUI-bound model.
///
/// `TextSearchEngine.matches` itself is pure and stateless — it recomputes
/// the full match list from scratch on every call. This type owns the state
/// a Find bar needs ON TOP of that: the current query/`SearchOptions`, the
/// last-computed match list, which match is "current" for Find Next/
/// Previous, and the wrap-around navigation those two actions apply (§6.14:
/// `SearchOptions.wraps` is real but was, until this slice, consumed
/// nowhere — this is that first consumer).
///
/// This type never mutates live text and never scrolls or selects anything
/// itself — callers read `currentMatch` and act on it via
/// `EditorTextSystem`'s own existing `revealSelection(utf16Range:flash:animated:)`.
/// It also never recomputes `matches` on its own: `query`/`options` changes
/// do NOT auto-trigger a search, because this model has no access to the
/// live document text (that lives in whatever `EditorTextSystem` the Find
/// bar is attached to) — callers must explicitly call `updateMatches(in:)`
/// whenever the query, options, or underlying document text changes.
