    /// line height and pushes its glyphs' baseline down within that taller
    /// box by an amount that depends on the font/multiple, not a fixed
    /// constant — a caller that drew a label using only the fragment's own
    /// top edge (ignoring this) would draw it measurably higher than the
    /// real text's baseline. `glyphOrigin`/`typographicBounds` are pure
    /// font+paragraph-style metrics (verified empirically: identical across
    /// every line in a document, including an EMPTY line's own zero-glyph
    /// fragment, which still reports the same `glyphOrigin.y` as a
    /// non-empty one), never content-dependent, so this generalizes to any
    /// font, size, theme, or zoom level without a hand-tuned offset.
