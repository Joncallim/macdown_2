// MARK: - Toggle Comment (EPIC-22 §6.13, Slice 4c-iii)

/// Pure, synchronous logic for Toggle Comment — the last of Slice 4c's ten
/// built-in transforms. Reuses `EditorLineTransforms`' own line-block
/// merging (the same "two carets on the same/adjacent lines must not
/// produce overlapping replacements" concern every other multi-line
/// transform in this epic already solved) and `EditorLineTransforms.makeTransaction`.
///
/// "Smart toggle" semantics (VSCode/Sublime/Xcode's shared convention): if
/// every touched line already starts (after its own leading whitespace)
/// with the effective profile's `lineComment` prefix, remove it from every
/// line that has it; otherwise add it to every line that doesn't. A profile
/// with no `lineComment` (Markdown, HTML, XML, CSS in this codebase's own
/// registry — a REAL, common case, not a rare edge case) falls back to
/// wrapping the whole block once with `blockComment`'s `open`/`close`
/// instead. A profile with neither declines the WHOLE command (matching
/// this epic's established "the whole command disables rather than
/// silently half-applying" precedent for Sort/Dedupe/Indent) — a MIXED
/// selection where one merged group's own effective profile has comment
/// syntax and another's doesn't is treated the same way, not partially
/// applied.
