    /// `shouldChangeTextInRanges:replacementStrings:`, is the real
    /// interception point. That delegate method was tried first and found,
    /// empirically (`EditorMultiSelectionTests` against a real mounted
    /// `NSTextView`), to never be invoked by ordinary
    /// `insertText(_:replacementRange:)`/`deleteBackward(_:)` regardless of
    /// how many `selectedRanges` are active — AppKit acts only on the
    /// primary selection for a plain keystroke, never fanning it out on its
    /// own.
    ///
    /// `selectionSet.ranges.count > 1` used to imply every one of those
    /// ranges was non-empty, back when this method was written for Slice
    /// 3a: `NSTextView.selectedRanges` itself collapses to a single range
    /// the instant more than one zero-length (bare caret) range — or any
    /// mix of a zero-length range with anything else — is assigned to it
    /// (§6.9's architecture-correction note), so a genuine multi-*caret*
    /// state could never reach here THROUGH `selectedRanges` alone. Slice
    /// 3b broke that premise: `EditorTextSystem.selectionSet` is now an
    /// independent cache that can legitimately hold a MIX of real
    /// selections and bare secondary carets at once (Option-click,
    /// Add/Remove Cursor Above/Below, and a ragged rectangular selection —
    /// Slice 3b-iv — where a spanned line shorter than the drag's own left
    /// edge produces a zero-length range) — so `count > 1` no longer
    /// guarantees non-emptiness on its own. Found by an independent
    /// hostile review of Slice 3b-iv: this method was missing the same
    /// `allSatisfy` guard `applyMultiCursorDeleteSelection()` already had,
    /// meaning a ragged rectangular selection's typing behavior (acts on
    /// every line) silently diverged from its own delete behavior (declines
    /// entirely, falls through to native single-range handling) for the
    /// identical selection — exactly the "mix of a real selection and bare
    /// synthetic carets" case §6.10 already disclosed as a distinct,
    /// not-yet-scoped follow-up, not something either method should
    /// silently half-support. Checked (`allSatisfy`), not trusted, for the
    /// same reason delete's own guard is checked rather than assumed.

    /// path), any range among them empty (see above), an active IME
