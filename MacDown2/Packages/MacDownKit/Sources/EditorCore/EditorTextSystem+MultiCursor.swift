    /// non-empty: confirmed empirically that `NSTextView.selectedRanges`
    /// collapses to a single range the instant more than one zero-length
    /// (bare caret) range — or any mix of a zero-length range with anything
    /// else — is assigned to it, so a genuine multi-*caret* state can never
    /// reach here in the first place (§6.9's architecture-correction note).

    /// at the primary selection and simply not happen at the others);

    /// unchanged — fewer than two active selections (the overwhelmingly
    /// common case, left entirely to AppKit/E10's existing single-range
    /// path), an active IME composition (fails open, matching every other
