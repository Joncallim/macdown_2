    /// Reimplements the per-line transform inline (duplicating those two
    /// functions' own tiny closures, rather than calling them) rather than
    /// widening their access, because of a P1 an independent hostile review
    /// found in this method's first version: calling `indentSelectedLines`/
    /// `unindentSelectedLines` with a REPRESENTATIVE range covering the
    /// group's WHOLE line-block (needed so the text edit itself is correct)
    /// also made THEM compute `resultingSelection` for that same whole
    /// block — so even the single-caret, single-line common case installed
    /// a full-line SELECTION instead of leaving a collapsed caret, meaning
    /// the very next keystroke after ⌘]/⌘[ would replace the entire
    /// (re-)indented line. Computing this method's OWN per-line deltas
    /// (identical logic, `indentedLines`/`unindentedLines` below) instead
    /// makes `MarkdownEditingAssistEngine.remappedSelection` — already
    /// internal, the same primitive `transformSelectedLines` itself uses —
    /// directly callable on each GROUP MEMBER's own original position,
    /// which is what actually produces a correct per-member result.
    ///
    /// Line-block merging (`EditorLineTransforms.mergedLineBlockGroups`) is
    /// required for the same reason Sort/Dedupe need it: two carets on the
    /// same or adjacent lines would otherwise each independently expand to
    /// the SAME touched line(s), producing two overlapping (invalid)
    /// replacements. A DISCLOSED simplification for the resulting rare
    /// multi-member-per-group case: every member of a merged group is
    /// remapped independently and correctly (each keeps its own column),
    /// but if two members' own remapped positions happen to coincide (e.g.
    /// two bare carets on the exact same line), `EditorSelectionSet`'s own
    /// duplicate-caret merge rule collapses them to one — matching every
    /// other multi-cursor command's established convergence behavior in
    /// this codebase, not a defect specific to this one.
