/// exclusion list the way `MathContribution.excludedRanges(in:)` does.

/// Recurses into `block.children` rather than only `document.blocks`

/// (epic-19-implementation.md §21): a fenced code block nested inside a list
/// item or block quote is a CHILD of that block in `MarkdownBlock`'s tree,
/// not a top-level sibling, and would be silently missed by a shallow scan.
