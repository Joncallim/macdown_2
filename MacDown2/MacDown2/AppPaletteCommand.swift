/// One app command the command palette can invoke, distinct from a

/// small, explicit, hand-maintained array — not generated from
/// `WorkspaceCommands` — per that section's accepted drift-risk tradeoff at
/// this list's current size. `@MainActor` because `action` manipulates the
/// (also `@MainActor`) `WindowCoordinator`.
///
/// `action`/`isAvailable` both take the palette's captured origin
/// `WindowController` (`nil` if the palette was opened with no document
/// window, or the origin has since closed) rather than resolving
/// `NSApp.keyWindow` themselves — the palette panel *is* the key window
/// while these run, so a command that resolved its own target internally
/// would silently act on the palette instead of the originating document
/// (post-review finding #7).
