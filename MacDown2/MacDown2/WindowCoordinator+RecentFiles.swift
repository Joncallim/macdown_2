/// `WindowCoordinator.swift` for the same reason
/// `WindowCoordinator+FileTree.swift`'s own `openRecentFolder(_:)` is: a
/// distinct, self-contained menu-action concern.
///
/// Recording into `recentFileDocuments` happens once, centrally, inside
/// `WindowCoordinator.openDocument(at:...)` — the single choke point every
/// real, user-initiated file open routes through (Open…, Open Recent File,
/// Quick Open, sidebar double-click, and Finder/dock/launch-argument opens
/// via `AppDelegate`) — so this file only has to resolve a chosen recent
/// entry back to a real, openable URL. Session restore deliberately does
/// NOT go through `openDocument(at:...)` (it calls
/// `tabStore.newTab(id:document:)` directly instead), so relaunching the
/// app never re-promotes already-open documents to the front of the
/// recent-files list on every launch.

    /// this one). A `nil` resolution (the bookmark's target no longer
    /// exists) silently does nothing — `pruneMissingFiles()` already keeps

        // bookmark/resolve against the physical, symlink-*resolved* target,
        // so opening `resolution.accessURL` here would silently open the
        // real target file instead of the alias the user actually clicked --
        // changing its window title, its `fileURL`, and (via
        // `openDocument`'s own `recentFileDocuments.record(url)`) even which
        // path gets re-recorded, all without the user asking for that.
