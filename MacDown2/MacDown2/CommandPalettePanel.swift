/// Ownership (post-review finding #6): `NSPanel`'s `isReleasedWhenClosed`
/// defaults to `false` — unlike many `NSWindow`s, AppKit does **not**
/// deallocate this panel on its own when it closes, so something must hold
/// a strong reference for exactly as long as the panel should exist.
/// `WindowCoordinator` is that owner (`commandPalette` in
/// `WindowCoordinator+CommandPalette.swift`); this panel is its own
/// delegate purely to notify the coordinator when it closes
/// (`commandPaletteDidClose`), so that strong reference is released and a
/// closed panel is never mistaken for a reusable, still-open one. The panel
/// holds only a `weak` reference back to the coordinator, so there is no
/// retain cycle: coordinator → panel is the only strong edge.
