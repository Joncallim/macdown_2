# MacDown 2

A native macOS Markdown editor — a ground-up Swift / SwiftUI rewrite built on
TextKit 2, a modular Swift package core, and a modern SwiftUI shell.

> **Status:** active development, feature epics in progress (updated
> 2026-09-17). Implemented and merged: project foundations, file/format
> core, the native-`NSWindow`-tab workspace shell, the TextKit 2 editor,
> tree-sitter highlighting and the theme system, the native Markdown parser
> and block-sliced Textual preview, the heading outline and lazy folder
> browser, JSON/HTML multi-format support, Markdown editing assists,
> HTML/PDF export with a shared derived-content destination, a native
> SwiftUI Settings scene, first-party contribution infrastructure (table of
> contents, local text-filter commands, command palette), live
> external-file change detection/conflict handling, first-class
> math/scientific-notation rendering ($…$ / $$…$$) in preview and export,
> and a native diagram platform with Mermaid support (```mermaid``` fences
> rendered in preview and exported as genuine vector SVG).
>
> Known open work before macOS 1.0: a narrower external-file-change
> notice-banner issue is tracked as
> [#70](https://github.com/Joncallim/macdown_2/issues/70) (the core
> defect, #59, is fixed); a narrower Preview-only math/nested-code-fence
> edge case is tracked as
> [#63](https://github.com/Joncallim/macdown_2/issues/63); PDF export
> pagination has no automated test coverage yet
> ([#13](https://github.com/Joncallim/macdown_2/issues/13)); E20's own live
> in-app UI-test execution and visual dogfood remain open, tracked in
> `RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md`. The remaining planned epics — engineering renderer
> evaluation (D2/Graphviz/WaveDrom), whole-app accessibility and polish,
> localisation, and signed/distributable release engineering — have not
> started. See
> [`planning/epics/README.md`](planning/epics/README.md) for the full epic
> table and [`planning/RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md`](planning/RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md)
> for the release-readiness ledger, which distinguishes "implemented" from
> "release-proven" per epic.

## Requirements

- macOS 26.0 or later
- Xcode 26 (Swift 6.2 toolchain, strict concurrency)
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) — the `.xcodeproj` is generated, not committed

## Building

```bash
# 1. Logic package — build + test (all unit tests live here)
cd MacDown2/Packages/MacDownKit
swift build
swift test

# 2. Generate the Xcode project
cd ../..
xcodegen generate

# 3. Build the app and the CLI
xcodebuild -project MacDown2.xcodeproj -scheme MacDown2  -destination 'platform=macOS' build
xcodebuild -project MacDown2.xcodeproj -scheme macdown2  -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

## Linting

```bash
swiftformat --lint MacDown2
swiftlint   lint --strict MacDown2
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the lint, package tests, and app/CLI builds
on every push and PR to `master`.

## Roadmap

Development is organised into epics, each tracked as a GitHub issue with a spec in
[`planning/epics/`](planning/epics/) and a detailed implementation plan in
[`planning/`](planning/). See [`planning/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](planning/MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
for the overall plan.
