# EPIC-09 Implementation Plan — Folder browser: lazy file tree, FS watching, CRUD

> **Issue:** #10 — [EPIC-09] Folder browser: lazy file tree, FS watching, CRUD
> **High-level spec:** `planning/epics/EPIC-09-folder-browser.md` (scope/acceptance are binding, including the #28 amendment that the sidebar — and therefore the folder root — is per window).
> **Branch:** `epic/09-folder-browser` → PR into `master`.
> **Depends on:** E01 as built (`FileDocument`, `FileFormatRegistry`, `FileStore`), E02 as built (`WorkspaceModel`, `SidebarSection`, `WorkspaceStateStoring`), E03 as built (native `NSWindow` tabs, `WindowCoordinator`, per-window `WorkspaceModel`), E08 as built (the sidebar `List` this epic has to share).
> **Intended pipeline:** implemented by **Kimi K2.7** in a single pass, reviewed by **DeepSeek**. Written so that **neither has to guess intent or fill gaps.** Read **§2 (what already exists and what collides)**, **§3 (decisions)**, and **§4.2–4.6 (API contract)** before writing code — reviews reject on §3 and §4.
>
> **No new third-party dependencies.** The `FileTree` target already exists in `Package.swift` with `dependencies: ["FileCore"]`, already has a `FileTreeTests` test target, and is already listed under the `MacDown2` app target in `project.yml` (E00 scaffolding). **No `Package.swift` change, no `project.yml` change, no `ci.yml` change.**
>
> **Pre-flight:** `master` is green at `61cad7c` — `swiftformat --lint MacDown2` reports `0/149 files require formatting` and `swiftlint lint --strict MacDown2` reports `0 violations`. No drive-by lint commit needed.
>
> **Two platform facts in this plan were checked, not assumed** (Swift 6.3.3 / macOS 26, `-swift-version 6 -strict-concurrency=complete`), because the design turns on them and both are commonly mis-remembered. A nonisolated `deinit` on a `@MainActor` class **can** read isolated stored properties but **cannot** call an isolated method (D5). `bookmarkData(options: .withSecurityScope)` **succeeds unsandboxed**, resolves, and `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` returns `true` (D14). Earlier drafts of both sections said the opposite; the corrections are recorded inline so a reviewer does not have to re-derive them.
>
> **⚠️ This is the first epic to add real concurrency since E07.** `DispatchSource` handlers run off the main actor and hop back onto it. CI runs Xcode 26.0.1, which has rejected concurrency code the newer local toolchain accepted (E07). **Push and read CI before calling any of §4.5 verified** — see §9.

## 1. Ground rules (binding, carried from E00–E08)

1. **macOS 26.0 only. No availability checks.** Swift 6.2, `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete`, zero warnings.
2. **Package holds the logic; the app holds glue.** Sorting, filtering, diffing, flattening, name uniquing, and every CRUD precondition are pure, `Sendable`, headless, and tested under `swift test`. The app target owns only: view code, alerts, menu commands, and the wiring between the sidebar and the window/tab pool.
3. **Same architecture rule as `FileCore` (the epic says so explicitly): pure synchronous model core, async edges.** There are exactly **two** IO seams in this module — `DirectoryReading` (list a directory) and `FileSystemMutating` (create/move/copy/trash) — plus the watcher. Everything else is a function of `[DirectoryEntry]`.
4. **Native controls, native behaviors.** `List` rows, `.contextMenu`, `.draggable`/`.dropDestination`, `NSAlert` for destructive confirms, `FileManager.trashItem` for delete. No custom outline widget, no re-implementation of drag arbitration.
5. **Tests are Swift Testing (`@Test`/`#expect`)**, not XCTest — except `MacDown2UITests`, where `XCUIApplication`-hosted bundles cannot `import Testing` (verified during E07; not a convention violation).
6. **Graceful totality.** Every input produces a defined state. A missing root, an unreadable directory, a folder emptied *by the filter* rather than by its contents, a drop onto a file, a rename to a name that already exists, a move into a folder's own subtree — all have named, tested outcomes. There is no "this shouldn't happen" branch.
7. **Tabs are native `NSWindow` tabs.** One window = one document. "Opens in a tab" means `WindowCoordinator.openDocument(at:)`, which already dedupes across every window and selects the existing tab when the file is already open.
8. **Unsandboxed (migration-plan D7), modeled on security-scoped URLs.** See D14 — this constrains *how* we persist roots, and the plan takes the constraint seriously rather than writing `.withSecurityScope` into code that cannot use it.

## 2. Ground truth: what exists, what is missing, what collides

### 2.1 The `FileTree` module is a one-line stub and everything around it is already wired

```swift
// Sources/FileTree/FileTree.swift — as built
public enum FileTree { public static let moduleName = "FileTree" }
```

`Package.swift` already declares the product, the target (`dependencies: ["FileCore"]`) and `FileTreeTests`; `project.yml` already lists `FileTree` under the app target. This epic fills the stub in. **If a `Package.swift` or `project.yml` diff appears in this PR, something has gone wrong** (§6).

### 2.2 `Open Folder…` already exists and already does nothing

`WorkspaceCommands` binds ⌘⇧O to `coordinator?.keyModel?.openFolder()`, which sets `WorkspaceModel.folderURL` (per window, `private(set)`). `SidebarView.folderContent` renders exactly one line — `Text(folderURL.lastPathComponent)` — or `"No folder opened"`. So the command, the panel (`NSFilePanelProvider.chooseFolder()`, `canChooseDirectories = true`), the per-window storage, and the sidebar section all exist. **This epic does not add "open a folder"; it adds everything the opened folder was supposed to do.**

What is missing on `WorkspaceModel`: a way to set the root *without* a panel (needed by recents and by "reveal a file outside the root"), and any persistence of the root at all.

### 2.3 ⚠️ Collision: the sidebar `List` has exactly one `selection` binding, and E08 owns it

```swift
// SidebarView.swift — as built
List(selection: $outlineController.selectedItemID) { ... }   // Binding<Int?>
```

`List(selection:)` takes **one** `Hashable` type for the whole list. E08 bound it to `OutlineItem.id`, which is an `Int` ordinal. Folder rows need to be selectable in the *same* `List` — they are rows of the same list, in a sibling `Section` — and their identity is a URL, not an ordinal. There is no way to have two selection bindings on one `List`.

This is not a detail that can be discovered during implementation and patched: it changes the type at the top of `SidebarView`, it changes what `.tag(...)` carries on every row including E08's, and it changes what `.onKeyPress(.return)` dispatches on. The resolution is **D8**. It is deliberately contained in the app target so that neither `OutlineUI` nor `FileTree` learns the other exists.

### 2.4 ⚠️ Blocker for acceptance box 3: `FileDocument` cannot be renamed

Acceptance: *"Renaming an open file updates tab title + save target."*

```swift
// FileCore/FileDocument.swift — as built
public let id: String          // fileURL.absoluteString for file-backed documents
public var fileURL: URL?
public let format: FileFormat  // derived from fileURL's path extension at init
```

`fileURL` is settable, so the *save target* can be moved. `id` and `format` cannot. Consequences of setting only `fileURL`:

- **`format` goes stale.** Rename `notes.md` → `notes.txt` and the document keeps `markdown`: the preview stays a Markdown preview, tree-sitter stays on the markdown grammar, and E08's outline stays populated. `WindowController.updateTitleAndEditedState()` already re-attaches the highlighter when `format.highlightLanguageID` changes — that machinery works, it just never fires, because `format` never changes.
- **`id` goes stale.** `id` is the `RecoveryBuffer` key and the `documentID` in `WindowCoordinator.saveSession`. A dirty renamed document autosaves under its old path-derived key. No user-visible symptom today (recovery restore is keyed by `untitledDocumentID`, which is nil for file-backed documents), but it is a latent inconsistency and it costs one method to not have.

The window **title** is fine either way: `updateTitleAndEditedState()` reads `model.activeDocument?.fileURL?.lastPathComponent` on a 250 ms poll, so the title follows `fileURL` within one tick. (That tick is why the UI test in §7 must wait rather than assert immediately.)

Fix in D12: relax `id` and `format` to `public private(set) var` and add `FileDocument.renamed(to:)`. Own commit, own tests, reviewable separately from the folder browser.

### 2.5 `FileFormat.format(for:in:)` returns `nil` for extensionless files

```swift
let pathExtension = url.pathExtension.lowercased()
guard !pathExtension.isEmpty else { return nil }
```

So `README`, `LICENSE`, `Makefile`, and `Dockerfile` are **not** "supported files" by the registry's own definition. This decides the behavior of the epic's *"Supported files only"* filter toggle for a very common case in exactly the folders a developer would open. Plan: the registry *is* the definition, so the filter hides them — and the filter therefore ships **off by default**, so it is always a deliberate user action. Flagged as open decision §10.1.

### 2.6 The watcher/E18 boundary, stated precisely

The #28 amendment: *"The `DispatchSource` watching in this epic covers the **directory tree UI only**; watching open documents for external changes (reload/conflict) is **E18**."* Two of E09's acceptance boxes are nonetheless about open documents:

> - Deleting the file open in the active tab offers close/discard flow; no crash
> - Renaming an open file updates tab title + save target

These are not in conflict, because **the epic also owns in-app CRUD**. The line is the *origin of the change*, not the effect:

| Change originates in | Tree updates | Open document reacts | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| The sidebar's own Delete / Rename / Move | yes | **yes — E09** | E09 |
| Finder, `git checkout`, another app | yes (watcher) | **not in E09** | tree: E09 · document: **E18** |

E09 implements the document consequences for the paths it triggers itself, where it knows old→new with certainty and needs no heuristics. It does **not** implement external-change detection for open documents — including for documents that happen to be inside the folder root. E18 generalizes that later for *all* open documents, root or not, and must not have to depend on this module (D11).

### 2.7 Related open issues this epic touches but does not close

- **#34 — sidebar layout caches go stale across windows.** Each window's `WorkspaceModel` hydrates `sectionOrder`/`sectionExpanded` from the shared `UserDefaults` suite once at init and never re-reads, so a second window reorders using stale input. E09 adds three more persisted view preferences (hidden files, supported-only, folders-first) plus a recent-roots list. **Adding them the same way would ship the same bug four more times.** D7 is how this plan avoids that, and it is the *shared observable store* option that #34 itself lists. It does not retrofit `sectionOrder`/`sectionExpanded`, because #34 says the app-wide-vs-per-window question must be answered first.
- **#35 — non-Markdown documents are still fully Markdown-parsed.** Untouched here. Opening a `.py` file from the folder tree runs a full swift-markdown parse exactly as opening it from ⌘O does today.

## 3. Key architectural decisions (review anchors — do not silently deviate)

### D1 — `FileTree` depends on `FileCore` and nothing else
Not `Workspace`, not `EditorCore`, not `OutlineUI`, not `Preview`. The module receives a root URL, a filter, and a set of supported extensions; it publishes rows, availability, and CRUD outcomes. Tabs, windows, alerts, and menus are the app target's business. This keeps the module headless-testable and keeps `Package.swift` unchanged. `FileCore` is needed only for `FileFormatRegistry` (the supported-extension set) — and even that is passed in as a `Set<String>`, so the coupling is one initializer parameter, not a dependency inside the pure functions.

### D2 — Two IO seams, both injected; everything else is pure
```
DirectoryReading      →  list one directory  →  [DirectoryEntry]
FileSystemMutating    →  create / move / copy / trash
DirectoryWatching     →  tell me when a directory changed (no payload)
```
Filtering, sorting, diffing, flattening to rows, name uniquing, and every CRUD precondition are pure functions of `[DirectoryEntry]` and `String`. **Consequence for tests:** sort/filter/diff/naming tests need no temp directory and no `async`; only the reader, the mutator, and the real watcher touch disk. Any test that creates a temp directory to assert a sort order is testing the wrong seam.

### D3 — Lazy loading is per-directory load state keyed by URL
`FileTreeModel` holds `expanded: Set<URL>`, `children: [URL: DirectoryLoadState]`, and `watchers: [URL: DirectoryWatcher]`. Expanding a directory transitions `.notLoaded → .loading → .loaded([DirectoryEntry])` (or `.failed`). Collapsing **keeps the cached children and drops the watcher** — re-expanding is then instant and correct, because the focus rescan (D6) and the parent's own watcher cover anything that changed while it was closed. Loading a directory never loads its grandchildren; a directory's row shows a disclosure chevron based on `isDirectory` alone, never on "does it have children" (which would cost a listing per row).

### D4 — Node identity is the standardized file URL, and it is normalized at exactly one place
`DirectoryEntry.url` is always `standardizedFileURL`, and always constructed with the correct `isDirectory` flag. This is not pedantry:

- `URL` is `Hashable` on its **string**, so `file:///a/b` and `file:///a/b/` are different keys. Mix the two and a directory can be expanded and collapsed at the same time.
- `standardizedFileURL` removes `.`/`..` and does **not** resolve symlinks. **Never call `resolvingSymlinksInPath`.** Resolving would relocate a symlinked folder's children under the target's path, breaking the parent→child relationship the tree is built from.

Normalization happens in `DirectoryEntry.init` and nowhere else, so there is one place to get it right and one test to pin it.

Unlike E08's ordinals, URLs are stable across re-scans, so **collapse state and selection need no identity remap** — the `OutlineIdentityMap` machinery has no counterpart here. Renaming *does* change identity, deliberately: an in-app rename carries old→new and re-keys `expanded`/`children`/`watchers` explicitly (D10); an external rename arrives as remove+add and the node collapses. That is the honest outcome and it matches every file browser on the platform.

### D5 — One `DispatchSource` per watched directory; the fd closes in the cancel handler; the watcher is **not** `@MainActor`
```swift
let fd = open(url.path, O_EVTONLY)
let source = DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource(
    fileDescriptor: fd, eventMask: [.write, .delete, .rename, .revoke], queue: queue)
source.setCancelHandler { close(fd) }     // ← the ONLY close. Never close before cancel.
source.setEventHandler { ... }
source.resume()
```
Two things are load-bearing:

1. **`close(fd)` belongs in the cancel handler and nowhere else.** Closing before the source finishes cancelling is a use-after-close on a descriptor the kernel may still be delivering events for, and the number it leaves behind can be reused by an unrelated `open` in the same process. `DispatchSource.cancel()` is idempotent and the cancel handler runs at most once, so this closes exactly once.
2. **`DirectoryWatcher` is a plain `final class`, not `@MainActor`.** The reason is narrower than "a main-actor `deinit` can't see its own state", which is **not true** — verified on the local toolchain (Swift 6.3.3, `-swift-version 6 -strict-concurrency=complete`): a nonisolated `deinit` on a `@MainActor` class *can* read isolated stored properties and call nonisolated methods on them, so `deinit { source.cancel() }` compiles. What it **cannot** do is call an isolated instance method — `deinit { cancelIsolated() }` fails with `#ActorIsolatedCall`. That is the trap: the natural refactor (a `cancel()`/`tearDown()` helper called from both the explicit path and `deinit`) stops compiling the moment the type is main-actor-isolated, and the usual escape — `Task { @MainActor in self.cancel() }` in `deinit` — resurrects `self` and never runs. Keeping the fd-owning type non-isolated makes plain RAII expressible, so "no fd leaks" is a property of the type rather than of every call site. Explicit `tearDown()` from `windowWillClose` stays as belt-and-braces.

**Watch scope is the root plus every expanded directory** — that is the acceptance criterion ("watching scoped to expanded folders"), and it is what bounds the fd count. Instrumentation for the test: `FileTreeModel.watchedDirectoryCount`. The criterion "no fd leaks" is tested as *that count returns to zero* after collapse-all and after `tearDown()`, plus a churn test that expands/collapses repeatedly and asserts the count stays bounded — not by shelling out to `lsof`.

### D6 — A filesystem event is a hint, not a payload: re-list, diff, apply
`DispatchSource` tells you a directory changed, not what changed. So every event does: re-list → `FileTreeDiff.diff(old:new:)` → apply. The diff is not an optimization detail, it is what makes the design viable:

- The watcher fires on **any** write inside the directory, including MacDown's own atomic save writing `.notes.md.tmp-<uuid>` and replacing `notes.md`. That is several events per save, on a directory whose *listing* is unchanged. Without a diff, every keystroke-triggered save would rebuild and re-render the tree.
- A removed **directory** needs its watcher cancelled and its cached subtree evicted. Only the diff knows which entries left.

Events are coalesced per directory on a **250 ms** debounce before the re-list (comfortably inside the "< 1 s" acceptance box, and enough to swallow a `git checkout`'s burst). Additionally, `windowDidBecomeKey` triggers `rescanExpandedDirectories()` — the safety net for events dropped while the app was inactive or App Nap throttled the queue. Both paths are the same re-list-and-diff, so they are idempotent and may race harmlessly.

The event handler runs on a background queue and hops to the main actor to apply. The re-listing itself must happen **off** the main actor — a 10k-entry directory takes long enough that doing it inline would drop frames.

### D7 — Filters, sort, and recents are app-wide state in **one shared observable object**, not per-window caches
`FileTreePreferences` is a single `@MainActor @Observable` instance created once by `AppDelegate` and injected into every `WindowController`. It writes through to `UserDefaults` on mutation and is read directly — there is no per-window cached copy, therefore nothing to go stale, therefore #34's failure mode cannot occur for this state.

This is a deliberate, narrow application of the fix #34 proposes ("a shared observable store object"). It does **not** retrofit `sectionOrder`/`sectionExpanded`, because #34 is explicit that the app-wide-vs-per-window product question has to be answered before that state moves. What it does do is refuse to add four more instances of a bug that is already on the tracker (§10.9).

The **root** stays per window (`WorkspaceModel.folderURL`), per the #28 amendment. Preferences are app-wide; the thing being browsed is not.

### D8 — The sidebar gets one selection type; both modules stay ignorant of each other
```swift
// App target — MacDown2/SidebarSelection.swift
enum SidebarSelection: Hashable {
    case outline(Int)      // OutlineItem.id
    case file(URL)         // DirectoryEntry.url
}
```
`SidebarView` binds `List(selection:)` to a `Binding<SidebarSelection?>` whose getter/setter project into `outlineController.selectedItemID` and `fileTreeModel.selectedURL`. `OutlineUI`'s public API does not change; `FileTree`'s does not mention outlines. `.onKeyPress(.return)` switches on the case: `.outline` → `outlineController.activate(id)`, `.file` → open in a tab (or expand, for a directory).

Rejected alternatives, for the record: two `List`s (impossible inside one sidebar list); leaving `List(selection:)` on outline ordinals and hand-rolling folder-row highlighting (loses native arrow-key traversal, which acceptance box 5 of *E08* already established as the bar).

### D9 — `FolderAvailability` is a typed enum with six cases, and "empty" is two of them
| Case | Condition | Sidebar shows |
|---|---|---|
| `.noRoot` | no folder opened in this window | "No folder opened" + Open Folder… hint |
| `.loading` | first listing of the root in flight | a progress row (not an empty state — no flash) |
| `.rootUnreadable(reason:)` | root missing, not a directory, or `EACCES` | the reason + "Choose Another Folder…" |
| `.empty` | root listed, genuinely contains nothing | "Empty folder" |
| `.emptyAfterFilter` | root has entries, **filters hid all of them** | "No matching files" + "Clear filters" |
| `.ready` | ≥1 visible row | the tree |

`.emptyAfterFilter` earns its own case because the alternative is a user turning on "Supported files only" in a folder of `.py` files and concluding the app is broken. Collapsing it into `.empty` would be the same class of mistake E08 avoided by splitting `.noHeadings` from `.notParsed`.

### D10 — CRUD = pure naming/validation + a thin mutating seam; the model re-keys its own state on rename
Every precondition is decided before any syscall, by a pure function that returns a typed error:

- empty name, name containing `/` or `:`
- name collides with a sibling — compared **case-insensitively**, because APFS is case-insensitive by default, and **excluding the item's own current name**, because `notes.md` → `Notes.md` is a legal case-only rename that a naive check rejects
- move into the source's own subtree — compared by **path components**, not string prefix (`/a/foo` is not inside `/a/foobar`)
- move to the directory it is already in (no-op, not an error)

Uniquing follows Finder: `untitled.md` → `untitled 2.md`; duplicate is `notes.md` → `notes copy.md` → `notes copy 2.md`. Delete is `FileManager.trashItem(at:resultingItemURL:)` behind an `NSAlert` confirm — never `removeItem`.

On a successful in-app rename or move, `FileTreeModel.itemWasRenamed(from:to:)` re-keys `expanded`, `children`, and `watchers` for the moved node **and every cached descendant path**, so an expanded folder stays expanded when it is renamed. The watcher's own event for the same change then diffs to nothing (D6), which is exactly why both paths being idempotent matters.

### D11 — In-app CRUD drives the open-document consequences; external changes do not (E18 boundary)
`WindowCoordinator` gets two intents, both driven only from the sidebar's own operations (§2.6):

- `documentWasRenamed(from:to:)` — find the tab (across all windows) whose `document.fileURL` standardizes to `from`, apply `FileDocument.renamed(to:)`. Title, save target, format, highlighter, and preview routing all follow from that one call (D12).
- `documentFileWasDeleted(at:)` — find the tab; **clean** documents close their window (there is nothing to discard, and an OK-only alert is noise); **dirty** documents raise one alert — *Save As… / Close Without Saving / Keep Open* — with "Keep Open" leaving the document exactly as it was, so ⌘S recreates the file.

The tab lookup and the clean/dirty verdict are a pure, testable intent on `TabStore` (§4.6); only the alert lives in the app target. The watcher does **not** call either of these.

### D12 — `FileDocument.renamed(to:)`, and `id`/`format` relax from `let` to `private(set) var`
```swift
// FileCore/FileDocument.swift
public private(set) var id: String        // was: let
public private(set) var format: FileFormat // was: let

/// Re-points a file-backed document at a moved/renamed file. Preserves `text`,
/// `state`, and `lastKnownModificationDate`; recomputes `id` and `format` from
/// the new URL exactly as `init` would (§2.4). No IO.
public func renamed(to url: URL) -> FileDocument
```
Source-compatible for every existing reader. This is the whole of acceptance box 3 and it is one method; the alternative — mutating `fileURL` alone — silently leaves a `.txt` file being previewed and highlighted as Markdown. Lands as its own commit before any folder-browser code (§8.1).

Deliberately **not** in scope: making `saveAs(_:)` re-key `id` the same way. It has the same staleness, it predates this epic, and changing it moves the `RecoveryBuffer` key for untitled documents mid-flight — a session-restore concern that wants its own change. Flagged in §10.10.

### D13 — The per-window root persists in `TabRecord` as bookmark `Data?`; **no session version bump**
`TabRecord` gains `folderRootBookmark: Data?`. Swift's synthesized `Codable` decodes a missing optional key as `nil`, so **existing `session.json` files still load** and `WorkspaceSession.currentVersion` stays `1`. Bumping it would make `loadSession()`'s `guard session.version == currentVersion` discard every existing user's open tabs — a data-loss change dressed as bookkeeping. Do not bump it.

Bookmarks rather than paths: a bookmark survives the folder being moved or renamed between launches, which a stored path does not. Security-scoped bookmarks specifically — see D14, they work unsandboxed and cost nothing extra.

### D14 — Security-scoped bookmarks are used **for real**, today; sandboxing then becomes an entitlement change only
Migration-plan D7: unsandboxed for now, *"`FileTreeModel` still designed around security-scoped URLs so sandboxing is additive later."*

An earlier draft of this section assumed `.withSecurityScope` throws without the sandbox entitlement and proposed a no-op seam instead. **That is wrong** — verified on the deployment target (macOS 26, Swift 6.3.3), unsandboxed:

```
dir.bookmarkData(options: .withSecurityScope)                → 736 bytes, no throw
URL(resolvingBookmarkData:options:[.withSecurityScope], …)   → resolves, stale == false
url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()                   → true
```

So the migration plan's aspiration is directly achievable now, and the plan takes it literally rather than stubbing it:

- Roots persist as `bookmarkData(options: .withSecurityScope)` (recents **and** `TabRecord.folderRootBookmark`).
- They resolve with `.withSecurityScope`, and a `bookmarkDataIsStale == true` resolution re-saves the bookmark (the folder moved).
- Every use of a resolved root is wrapped in a real RAII scope:

```swift
/// Balanced `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` / `stopAccessing…`.
/// `started` is checked because `stopAccessing…` must NOT be called when
/// `start` returned false — the calls are reference-counted and an unbalanced
/// stop decrements someone else's claim.
public final class FolderAccessScope {
    public init(url: URL)      // started = url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()
    deinit                     // if started { url.stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource() }
}
```

Turning the sandbox on later is then an entitlement change plus an open-panel-grants-access review — no bookmark format migration, no call sites to find. Note the scope object is a class with a `deinit`, not `~Copyable`: it must outlive the expression that created it and be released deterministically when the root changes.

**Do not** wrap freshly-panel-chosen URLs in a scope before they have been round-tripped through a bookmark — an un-bookmarked URL returns `false` from `start`, which is correct and must not be treated as an error.

### D15 — Rows are flattened **and stored**, not computed per body evaluation
`FileTreeModel.rows: [FileTreeRow]` is a stored property, recomputed only on structural change (expand, collapse, diff applied, filter changed, root changed). E08's `OutlineTree.visibleRows` is computed inside `SidebarView.body` and that is fine at outline scale; at 10 000 entries a per-body-evaluation flatten is the quadratic trap. `List` + `ForEach` stays lazy in AppKit's backing view, so only the flatten needs guarding — but it needs guarding.

Do **not** reach for `List(_:children:)`/`OutlineGroup`: the folder section lives inside a `DisclosureGroup` inside a `Section` inside the sidebar's existing `List`, and a `List` cannot nest in a `List`. Flatten-with-depth is the same shape E08 already renders (`OutlineRow(item:depth:)`), which is the point.

`FileTree` imports `Foundation`, `Observation`, `Dispatch`, and `FileCore`. Nothing else — **no `SwiftUI` import** (matching `OutlineUI`, whose `@Observable` controller imports only `Observation`), and **no `AppKit`**: file-type icons are `NSWorkspace.shared.icon(forFile:)` and therefore a view concern.

### 4.2 Public API contract — value types (`Sendable` + `Equatable` throughout)

```swift
// FileTree/DirectoryEntry.swift

/// every function downstream is pure.

    public static func arrange(

        supportedExtensions: Set<String>
    ) -> [DirectoryEntry]

    public let added: [DirectoryEntry]
    public let removed: [DirectoryEntry]

}

public enum FileTreeDiff {
    /// Set difference on `url`, then attribute comparison on the intersection.
    /// A rename is `removed` + `added`; no rename detection is attempted (D4).
    public static func diff(old: [DirectoryEntry], new: [DirectoryEntry]) -> DirectoryDiff
}

// FileTree/FileTreeRow.swift

/// One rendered row. `depth` is tree position; the view indents by it.

    public let entry: DirectoryEntry
    public let depth: Int

}

public enum FileTreeMoveValidation {
    /// Path-COMPONENT containment, not string prefix (D10).
    public static func validate(source: URL, intoDirectory destination: URL) -> FileTreeOperationError?
}
```

### 4.3 Public API contract — IO seams

```swift
// FileTree/DirectoryReading.swift

public protocol DirectoryReading: Sendable {
    /// Lists `url`'s immediate children. Throws for missing/unreadable/not-a-directory.
    func contents(of url: URL) throws -> [DirectoryEntry]
}

/// The real reader. MUST use the batched form:
///     contentsOfDirectory(at:includingPropertiesForKeys:options:)
/// with [.isDirectoryKey, .isHiddenKey, .isPackageKey, .isSymbolicLinkKey].
/// Fetching those keys per-URL afterwards is 4 × 10 000 extra stat calls and
/// is the difference between meeting and missing the 200 ms budget (§4.7).
public struct FileSystemDirectoryReader: DirectoryReading { public init() }

// FileTree/FileSystemMutating.swift

public protocol FileSystemMutating: Sendable {
    func createFile(at url: URL) throws
    func createDirectory(at url: URL) throws
    func move(from source: URL, to destination: URL) throws
    func copy(from source: URL, to destination: URL) throws
    /// `FileManager.trashItem` — never `removeItem` (D10).
    func trash(at url: URL) throws
}

public struct FileSystemMutator: FileSystemMutating { public init() }

// FileTree/DirectoryWatcher.swift

/// One `DispatchSource` over one directory fd.
///
/// NOT `@MainActor` (D5): a nonisolated `deinit` cannot call a main-actor
/// isolated method, so `deinit { cancel() }` — the whole point — only compiles
/// on a non-isolated type. `onChange` is invoked on `queue`; the callee hops to
/// the main actor.
public final class DirectoryWatcher: @unchecked Sendable {
    /// `@unchecked` because `DispatchSourceFileSystemObject` carries no
    /// `Sendable` conformance while being documented as thread-safe; the fd is
    /// owned solely by the cancel handler and is never read elsewhere.
    public init(url: URL, queue: DispatchQueue, onChange: @escaping @Sendable (DirectoryWatchEvent) -> Void) throws
    public func cancel()          // idempotent
    deinit                        // cancels
}

public enum DirectoryWatchEvent: Sendable, Equatable {
    case contentsChanged          // .write — re-list and diff
    case vanished                 // .delete / .rename / .revoke on the watched dir itself
}

public protocol DirectoryWatching: Sendable {
    func watch(_ url: URL, onChange: @escaping @Sendable (DirectoryWatchEvent) -> Void) throws -> DirectoryWatcherHandle
}
```

`DirectoryWatching` exists so `FileTreeModel` tests can inject a fake that records watched URLs and fires events **synchronously on demand** — no `Task.sleep`-and-hope. The real `DispatchSource` gets its own small integration test against a temp directory, using a bounded polling helper (house rule; `MarkdownEngineTests/Fixtures.wait` is the shape to copy).

### 4.4 Public API contract — the model

```swift
// FileTree/FileTreeModel.swift

/// Per-window folder-browser state (root is per window, #28). Main-actor
/// isolated: written from SwiftUI handlers and watcher hops, read from bodies.
@MainActor
@Observable
public final class FileTreeModel {
    public private(set) var root: URL?
    public private(set) var availability: FolderAvailability
    /// Flattened, depth-annotated, filter-applied. STORED (D15) — recomputed on
    /// structural change only, never per body evaluation.
    public private(set) var rows: [FileTreeRow]

    /// The user's selected node. Projected into `SidebarSelection` by the app (D8).
    public var selectedURL: URL?

    /// Non-nil while a row is in inline-rename mode. Consume-and-clear, same
    /// contract as `OutlineController.pendingJumpLineRange`.
    public var renamingURL: URL?

    /// Set by `open(_:)`; the app consumes it, opens a tab, and clears it.
    public var pendingOpenURL: URL?

    /// Instrumentation for the "no fd leaks" acceptance box (D5). Equals the
    /// number of live `DispatchSource`s: root + expanded directories.
    public var watchedDirectoryCount: Int { get }

    public init(
        reader: any DirectoryReading = FileSystemDirectoryReader(),
        mutator: any FileSystemMutating = FileSystemMutator(),
        watcher: any DirectoryWatching = FileSystemDirectoryWatching(),
        preferences: FileTreePreferences,
        supportedExtensions: Set<String>
    )

    // MARK: Root & structure
    public func setRoot(_ url: URL?) async
    public func expand(_ url: URL) async
    public func collapse(_ url: URL)          // keeps children cache, drops watcher (D3)
    public func toggleExpansion(_ url: URL) async
    /// `windowDidBecomeKey` (D6). Re-lists every expanded directory and applies
    /// diffs. A no-op diff produces no `rows` assignment and therefore no render.
    public func rescanExpandedDirectories() async
    /// Cancels every watcher. Idempotent; called from `windowWillClose`.
    public func tearDown()

    // MARK: Reveal
    /// Expands every ancestor from the root down and selects `url` (§4.8).
    /// Returns `false` when `url` is outside the current root or missing —
    /// the caller decides whether to offer "open its enclosing folder".
    @discardableResult
    public func reveal(_ url: URL) async -> Bool

    // MARK: CRUD — each validates purely, then performs exactly one syscall
    public func createFile(in directory: URL) async throws(FileTreeOperationError) -> URL
    public func createFolder(in directory: URL) async throws(FileTreeOperationError) -> URL
    public func rename(_ url: URL, to newName: String) async throws(FileTreeOperationError) -> URL
    public func duplicate(_ url: URL) async throws(FileTreeOperationError) -> URL
    public func move(_ url: URL, intoDirectory destination: URL) async throws(FileTreeOperationError) -> URL
    /// Caller shows the confirm alert first; this performs the trash.
    public func moveToTrash(_ url: URL) async throws(FileTreeOperationError)

    /// Re-keys `expanded`, `children` and `watchers` for a moved node and all
    /// cached descendants (D10). Called by the mutating methods above; exposed
    /// so a caller that moves a file by other means can keep the tree honest.
    public func itemWasRenamed(from old: URL, to new: URL)
}
```

**Threading:** the class is `@MainActor`. The `async` methods `await` the reader off the main actor (a detached listing) and apply results back on it. The watcher's `onChange` runs on its own queue and hops in via `Task { @MainActor in … }`. **No actor is introduced.** If the implementation reaches for one, that is a design error — the state is SwiftUI-observed and belongs on the main actor.

### 4.5 App-wide preferences and recents

```swift
// FileTree/FileTreePreferences.swift

/// ONE instance per process, created by `AppDelegate`, injected into every
/// window (D7). No per-window cached copy exists, so #34's staleness cannot
/// occur for this state.
@MainActor
@Observable
public final class FileTreePreferences {
    public var filter: FileTreeFilter          // write-through on didSet
    public var opensOnSingleClick: Bool        // default false (§10.3)
    public init(store: any FileTreePreferenceStoring = UserDefaultsFileTreePreferenceStore())
}

@MainActor
public protocol FileTreePreferenceStoring {
    var filter: FileTreeFilter { get set }
    var opensOnSingleClick: Bool { get set }
    var recentRootBookmarks: [Data] { get set }
}

// FileTree/RecentFolderRoots.swift

/// App-wide, most-recent-first, deduped by resolved URL, capped at 10.
/// Entries are `bookmarkData(options: .withSecurityScope)` — which works
/// unsandboxed and makes sandboxing an entitlement change only (D14).
@MainActor
@Observable
public final class RecentFolderRoots {
    public private(set) var roots: [URL]
    public func record(_ url: URL)
    /// Resolution failures (folder deleted) drop that entry and return nil.
    /// Stale-but-resolvable bookmarks resolve to the folder's new location and
    /// are re-saved in place.
    public func resolve(_ url: URL) -> URL?
    public func clear()
}
```

### 4.6 `Workspace` / `FileCore` additions contract (exact)

```swift
// FileCore/FileDocument.swift  (D12)
public private(set) var id: String
public private(set) var format: FileFormat
public func renamed(to url: URL) -> FileDocument

// Workspace/WorkspaceModel.swift
/// Sets the folder root without a panel (recents, reveal, session restore).
/// `openFolder()` becomes a thin wrapper: panel → setFolderRoot.
public func setFolderRoot(_ url: URL?)

// Workspace/TabStore.swift  — pure, synchronous, testable (D11)
public enum DeletedDocumentOutcome: Sendable, Equatable {
    case notOpen
    case closedCleanTab(UUID)
    case needsPrompt(UUID)          // the tab was dirty
}
public func tabID(forFileURL url: URL) -> UUID?      // standardized comparison
public func documentWasRenamed(from old: URL, to new: URL)
public func documentFileWasDeleted(at url: URL) -> DeletedDocumentOutcome

// Workspace/WorkspaceSession.swift  (D13)
public var folderRootBookmark: Data?    // NEW, optional → NO version bump
```

### 4.7 Performance: where the 200 ms goes

The budget is *"Folder with 10 000 entries → expand < 200 ms"*. Three costs, in the order they will bite:

1. **`localizedStandardCompare` — the likely failure point.** 10 000 entries is ~130 000 comparisons, and `localizedStandardCompare` is an ICU call, not a memcmp. This is the one number in the epic that plausibly blows the budget on its own. **Measure it first, in isolation, before building anything on top of it.** If it does not fit: precompute a sort key per entry once (`name.lowercased()` plus a digit-run-aware transform) and sort on that, keeping `localizedStandardCompare` only as the tie-break. Do not silently swap to `<` — "f10" before "f2" is a visible regression against Finder.
2. **The listing itself.** `contentsOfDirectory(at:includingPropertiesForKeys:options:)` with all four keys prefetched. The naive version — list URLs, then call `resourceValues` per URL — is 40 000 extra stats and will miss the budget by itself.
3. **The flatten.** Guarded by D15 (stored, not per-body). `List`/`ForEach` rendering is lazy in the AppKit backend and is not part of this budget.

The perf test measures **expand of a real 10 000-file temp directory**, end to end (list → arrange → flatten), because that is what the budget says. A synthetic `arrange`-only benchmark is useful for bisecting cost 1 but does not replace it.

### 4.8 App-target integration (exact wiring)

**`AppDelegate.swift`** — create `FileTreePreferences` and `RecentFolderRoots` once; pass both into `WindowCoordinator`.

**`WindowCoordinator.swift`**
- Hold the shared `preferences` / `recentRoots`; pass to each `WindowController`.
- `func openFolder(_ url: URL)` — `keyModel?.setFolderRoot(url)`, `recentRoots.record(url)`, `scheduleSaveSession()`.
- `func revealActiveFile()` — key controller → `fileTreeModel.reveal(activeDocument.fileURL)`; on `false`, offer to open the file's enclosing directory as the root.
- `func documentWasRenamed(from:to:)` / `func documentFileWasDeleted(at:)` — walk `controllers`, use the `TabStore` intents (§4.6), present the delete alert (D11). Called **only** from the sidebar's CRUD completion handlers.
- `saveSession()` — include the key window's `folderRootBookmark` in each `TabRecord`.

**`WindowController.swift`**
- `let fileTreeModel: FileTreeModel`, constructed alongside `outlineController`, with the injected shared preferences.
- Pass to `WorkspaceShellView` → `SidebarView`.
- `windowWillClose` → `fileTreeModel.tearDown()` in the same block as `parseStore.evictAll()`.
- `windowDidBecomeKey` → `Task { await fileTreeModel.rescanExpandedDirectories() }` (D6).

**`SidebarView.swift`** — the bulk of the app work:
- `List(selection:)` rebinds to `Binding<SidebarSelection?>` (D8); existing outline rows change `.tag(row.item.id)` → `.tag(SidebarSelection.outline(row.item.id))`.
- `folderContent` switches on `fileTreeModel.availability` (D9); `.ready` renders `ForEach(fileTreeModel.rows)`.
- `FileTreeRowView`: chevron for directories (from `isDirectory`, never from a child count), `NSWorkspace.shared.icon(forFile:)`, name, `.padding(.leading, depth * 14)`, `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` + `.contentShape(Rectangle())` + `.simultaneousGesture(TapGesture())` — **copy E08's gesture treatment verbatim**; its comments record why a plain `.onTapGesture` inside a `List` row intermittently does nothing.
- Inline rename: a `TextField` swapped in when `fileTreeModel.renamingURL == entry.url`; Return commits, Escape cancels, focus-loss commits.
- `.contextMenu`: New File, New Folder, Rename, Duplicate, Reveal in Finder, Move to Trash.
- `.draggable(entry.url)` + `.dropDestination(for: URL.self)` on directory rows and on the root header; dropping onto a *file* row targets its parent directory.
- Filter menu in the section header: Show Hidden Files, Supported Files Only, Folders First — bound straight to `preferences.filter`.
- `.onKeyPress(.return)` switches on the selection case (D8).
- Accessibility identifiers for the UI test: `folderSection`, `fileRow-<lastPathComponent>`, `newFileButton`.

**`WorkspaceCommands.swift`**
- `Menu("Open Recent Folder")` under Open Folder…, from `recentRoots.roots`, plus "Clear Menu".
- `Button("Reveal Active File")` — **⇧⌘J**, Xcode's "Reveal in Project Navigator" binding (§10.2), disabled without an active file-backed document.
- New File / New Folder in the folder root, disabled without a root.

**`WorkspaceShellView.swift`** — accept and pass through `fileTreeModel` (mirrors how `outlineController` threads through today).

### 4.9 Failure matrix (graceful totality)

| Input | Outcome |
|---|---|
| No folder opened | `.noRoot`; "No folder opened" + ⌘⇧O hint |
| Root deleted while open | watcher `.vanished` → `.rootUnreadable`; watchers cancelled; no crash |
| Root is a file, not a directory | `.rootUnreadable(reason:)` at `setRoot` |
| Directory unreadable (`EACCES`) | that row's load state is `.failed`; the row renders with a warning affordance; the rest of the tree is unaffected |
| Filters hide every entry | `.emptyAfterFilter` (D9) — never `.empty` |
| `supportedFilesOnly` on, folder of directories | directories always survive the filter (§4.2) |
| Extensionless file (`README`, `Makefile`) + `supportedFilesOnly` | hidden — the registry defines "supported" and returns nil for empty extensions (§2.5, §10.1) |
| Package directory (`.app`, `.rtfd`) | leaf row, no chevron, not expandable |
| Symlinked directory | expandable; the URL is standardized but **not** resolved, so children stay under the link's path (D4) |
| Watcher fires, listing unchanged (our own atomic save) | diff is empty → no `rows` assignment → no render (D6) |
| Expanded directory removed externally | diff `removed` → watcher cancelled, subtree cache evicted, rows rebuilt |
| Collapse then re-expand | instant from cache; correctness restored by the parent's watcher and the focus rescan (D3) |
| Rename `notes.md` → `Notes.md` (case only) | allowed — collision check excludes the item's own name (D10) |
| Rename to an existing sibling's name | `.nameExists`; no syscall attempted |
| Name containing `/` or `:` | `.nameContainsPathSeparator`; no syscall attempted |
| Drag a folder into its own descendant | `.moveIntoOwnSubtree`, decided by path components (`/a/foo` is not inside `/a/foobar`) |
| Drag onto the directory it is already in | no-op, not an error |
| Drop from Finder onto a file row | targets that file's **parent** directory |
| Rename an expanded folder | expansion, cache and watchers re-key to the new path; the folder stays open (D10) |
| Rename an **open** file | `FileDocument.renamed(to:)`; title (≤250 ms poll), save target, `format`, highlighter and preview routing all follow (D12) |
| Rename an open `.md` → `.txt` | format changes → highlighter re-attaches, preview routes to `NoPreviewView`, outline goes `.unsupportedFormat` — all existing machinery, now reachable |
| Delete an open **clean** document | its window closes; no alert (D11) |
| Delete an open **dirty** document | one alert: Save As… / Close Without Saving / Keep Open; "Keep Open" leaves ⌘S able to recreate the file |
| External delete/rename of an open document | tree updates; **the document does not react — E18** (§2.6) |
| Reveal a file outside the current root | `reveal` returns `false`; the command offers to open its enclosing folder |
| Reveal with no root open | same path as above |
| Recent root no longer exists | bookmark resolution fails → entry dropped from the list, nothing opens, no alert |
| Recent root was moved | bookmark resolves stale → root opens at the new location, bookmark re-saved (D14) |
| `session.json` written before this epic | `folderRootBookmark` decodes as `nil`, tabs restore normally — no version bump (D13) |
| 10 000-entry directory expanded | < 200 ms, measured end to end (§4.7) |
| Window closed with 30 directories expanded | `tearDown()` → `watchedDirectoryCount == 0` (D5) |

## 6. Build-config changes (exact)

**None.** `FileTree` is already a product in `Package.swift` with `dependencies: ["FileCore"]`, already has a `FileTreeTests` target, and is already listed under the `MacDown2` app target in `project.yml`. The new UI test file joins the existing `MacDown2UITests` target. `ci.yml` needs no change — `swift test` and `build-for-testing` already cover everything added here.

If a `Package.swift`, `project.yml`, or `ci.yml` diff appears in this PR, something has gone wrong.

## 7. Test plan (mapped to issue #10 acceptance + deliverables)

| # | Issue box / deliverable | Test (CI = `swift test` unless noted) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | External `touch new.md` in an expanded folder appears < 1 s | `DirectoryWatcherTests.realWatcherReportsExternalCreate`: real `DispatchSource` on a temp dir, `touch` a file, bounded poll (house-rule helper, never a fixed sleep) asserts the change is observed well inside 1 s. Plus `FileTreeModelTests.watchEventTriggersRelistAndDiff` with the **fake** watcher, which fires synchronously and asserts the resulting `rows` |
| 2 | Deleting the file open in the active tab offers close/discard; no crash | `TabStoreFileURLTests`: clean tab → `.closedCleanTab(id)`; dirty tab → `.needsPrompt(id)`; URL not open → `.notOpen`; a URL differing only by `.standardizedFileURL` normalization still matches. `FolderBrowserUITests` (local) drives the alert |
| 3 | Renaming an open file updates tab title + save target | `FileDocumentTests.renamedUpdatesURLIDAndFormat`: `notes.md` → `notes.txt` changes `fileURL`, `id`, **and** `format` while preserving `text`, `state`, `lastKnownModificationDate`. `TabStoreFileURLTests.documentWasRenamedRepointsTheTab`. `FolderBrowserUITests` (local) asserts the window title after the 250 ms poll |
| 4 | Watching scoped to expanded folders (no fd leaks, instrumented) | `FileTreeModelTests`: after `setRoot` → `watchedDirectoryCount == 1`; expand two → `3`; collapse one → `2`; `tearDown()` → `0`. `watchChurnStaysBounded`: 200 expand/collapse cycles, count never exceeds expanded+1 and ends at 0. `DirectoryWatcherTests.cancelIsIdempotent` (double-cancel must not double-close) |
| 5 | Filter toggle hides non-registered extensions immediately | `FileTreeArrangementTests`: `supportedFilesOnly` keeps `.md`/`.json`/`.py`, drops `.png`/`.o`, **keeps every directory**, drops extensionless files (§2.5 — pin the decision so a later change is a deliberate one). `FileTreeModelTests.filterChangeRebuildsRowsWithoutRelisting` — no `DirectoryReading` call on a filter flip |
| D2 | Tree diffing on FS events | `FileTreeDiffTests`: add-only, remove-only, both, attribute-changed, identical → `isEmpty`, empty↔populated, ordering-independence. `FileTreeModelTests.emptyDiffDoesNotReassignRows` — the render-suppression property D6 rests on |
| D2 | Sort / filter | `FileTreeArrangementTests`: `localizedStandardCompare` ordering (`f2` before `f10`, pinned explicitly); case-insensitive name order; `foldersFirst` on/off; hidden files on/off; dotfiles; combined filters; empty input |
| D2 | CRUD against temp dirs | `FileTreeCRUDTests` with the **real** mutator: create file/folder with uniquing; rename; rename case-only (`notes.md` → `Notes.md`) succeeds on APFS; duplicate produces `notes copy.md` then `notes copy 2.md`; move; move into own subtree rejected **before** any syscall; trash puts the item in the Trash and not in the void; collision rejected; every failure leaves the directory byte-identical |
| D3 | Perf: 10k-entry folder expand < 200 ms | `FileTreePerformanceTests.expandTenThousandEntries`: build the temp dir once, measure list→arrange→flatten (§4.7). Record the measured number in the PR — the comparator is the thing most likely to blow the budget |
| D4 | XCUITest: create file in sidebar → opens in tab | `FolderBrowserUITests` (local; `build-for-testing` in CI): launch with a folder root, New File in the sidebar, assert a new tab exists with the new name, then rename it in the sidebar and assert the tab title follows |
| — | Node identity / normalization (D4) | `DirectoryEntryTests`: trailing-slash directory URLs normalize to one key; `.`/`..` collapse; a symlinked directory keeps the **link's** path, not the target's |
| — | Reveal (§4.8) | `FileTreeModelTests`: reveal a deeply nested file expands every ancestor and selects it; reveal outside the root returns `false` and changes nothing; reveal with no root returns `false` |
| — | Rename re-keys tree state (D10) | `FileTreeModelTests.renamingAnExpandedFolderKeepsItExpanded`: expand `a/b/c`, rename `a/b` → `a/z`, assert `expanded`, the children cache, and the watcher set all moved to `a/z`, and that `watchedDirectoryCount` is unchanged |
| — | Availability totality (D9) | `FileTreeModelTests`: no root → `.noRoot`; unreadable root → `.rootUnreadable`; genuinely empty → `.empty`; all-filtered → `.emptyAfterFilter`; populated → `.ready`. All five asserted, none inferred |
| — | Preferences are app-wide (D7) | `FileTreePreferencesTests`: two `FileTreeModel`s sharing one `FileTreePreferences` both see a filter change (the #34 shape, pinned so it cannot regress into per-window caches) |
| — | Recents + security-scoped access (D14) | `RecentFolderRootsTests`: most-recent-first, dedupe, cap at 10, unresolvable bookmark drops silently, moved folder resolves via the bookmark and is re-saved. `FolderAccessScopeTests`: a scoped-bookmark round trip over a temp dir starts and stops exactly once, and a scope over a plain (un-bookmarked) URL reports not-started and does **not** call stop |
| — | Session compatibility (D13) | `WorkspaceSessionStoreTests`: a `session.json` written **without** `folderRootBookmark` still decodes with `version == 1` and full tabs |

House rules carried from E05–E08: `@Test`/`#expect` only; **no `Task.sleep`-and-hope** — await deterministic signals, or use a bounded polling helper for the one genuinely asynchronous seam (the real watcher); no real `UserDefaults` (in-memory suite); no fixture files checked into the repo — build temp trees in the test.

## 8. Implementation order (suite green at every step)

1. **D12 — `FileCore.FileDocument.renamed(to:)`** plus the `id`/`format` relaxation. Own commit, own tests. It is a `FileCore` change and review should see it separately from the folder browser.
2. `DirectoryEntry` + `DirectoryReading` + `FileSystemDirectoryReader` → normalization tests, real-temp-dir reader test.
3. `FileTreeFilter` + `FileTreeArrangement` → sort/filter tests. **Run the 10k comparator microbenchmark here** (§4.7) before anything is built on top of it.
4. `FileTreeDiff` → diff tests.
5. `FileTreeNaming` + `FileTreeOperations` validation → pure tests (no disk).
6. `FileSystemMutating` + `FileSystemMutator` → CRUD-against-temp-dir tests.
7. `DirectoryWatcher` + `DirectoryWatching` + the fake → real-watcher integration test, cancel/idempotence, fd-count instrumentation. **Push and check CI after this step** — it is the concurrency-heavy one (§9).
8. `FolderAvailability` + `FileTreeModel` → model tests with fakes (expand/collapse, load states, diff application, re-key on rename, reveal, availability totality, watch scope).
9. `FileTreePreferences` + store, `RecentFolderRoots`, `FolderAccessScope`.
10. `Workspace`: `setFolderRoot`, the three `TabStore` intents, `TabRecord.folderRootBookmark` (+ the pre-epic-JSON decode test).
11. App wiring: `AppDelegate` shared objects, `WindowController` ownership/teardown/focus-rescan, `WorkspaceShellView` pass-through.
12. `SidebarSelection` + `SidebarView` (D8 first, as its own commit — it touches E08's rows and should be reviewable without folder code mixed in), then the folder section, rows, context menu, inline rename, drag/drop, filter menu.
13. `WorkspaceCommands`: Open Recent Folder, Reveal Active File ⇧⌘J, New File/Folder.
14. `FileTreePerformanceTests` (10k); `FolderBrowserUITests`; local run.
15. README status + module map (`FileTree` no longer a stub).

## 9. Validation (must all pass before review)

```

**Push and read CI before declaring the watcher work verified.** CI runs Xcode 26.0.1, which rejected concurrency code the newer local toolchain accepted during E07. This epic adds a `DispatchSource`, a `@Sendable` escaping callback, an `@unchecked Sendable` class, and a background→main-actor hop — the largest concurrency surface since E07. "Builds locally" is not evidence here. Push after step 7 and again at the end.

Also record on the PR: the **measured 10k expand time** (§4.7) and the **`watchedDirectoryCount` behaviour** from the churn test — those are the two acceptance boxes whose numbers a reviewer cannot re-derive from the diff.

## 10. Open decisions (flag on the PR — do not silently resolve)

1. **"Supported files only" hides extensionless files** (§2.5). `README`, `LICENSE`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile` have no path extension, so `FileFormat.format(for:in:)` returns `nil` and the filter hides them. The plan treats the registry as the definition of "supported" and ships the filter **off by default**, so it is always a deliberate act. The alternative — a special case that keeps extensionless files — makes the filter's rule un-nameable. **Confirm before implementation.**
2. **⇧⌘J for Reveal Active File.** Free in the current command table (taken: ⌘N/⌘T/⌘O/⌘⇧O/⌘S/⌘⇧S/⌘W/⌘1–9/⌥⌘1–3/⌃⌘S/⌃⌘O/⌃Tab/⌃⇧Tab). Chosen for Xcode's "Reveal in Project Navigator" precedent. Verify against system-wide shortcuts on the reviewer's machine.
3. **Single- vs double-click to open.** The epic says "single/double per pref". The plan defaults to **double-click opens, single-click selects**, because under native tabs every open creates a window, and single-click-opens would spawn one per arrow-key-adjacent click. The pref exists and flips it; only the default is being asked about. (VS Code single-clicks because it has a reusable preview tab; we do not.)
4. **Drops from Finder copy; drags within the tree move.** Finder itself moves within a volume and copies across; matching that exactly means reading volume identifiers on every drag. The plan takes the simpler, more predictable rule and states it in the drop feedback. **Confirm, or accept the volume check as extra work.**
5. **Name collision on move/drop is rejected, not merged or auto-renamed.** Finder asks (Replace / Keep Both / Stop). A three-way sheet is real UI work for a case that is rare in a Markdown editor's sidebar. Plan: reject with the reason. Flag if Keep Both is wanted for v1.
6. **No cap on the number of watched directories.** Watch scope is already bounded by "expanded", which is bounded by the user's patience; the process fd budget is far above any plausible number of hand-expanded folders. A cap plus LRU eviction was considered and rejected as speculative — the instrumented count (D5) is what would reveal it becoming a problem. **Confirm no cap is acceptable**, given the acceptance box says "no fd leaks, instrumented" and not "bounded".
7. **`.emptyAfterFilter` offers a "Clear filters" button** (D9) that resets `preferences.filter` to defaults — app-wide, so it affects every window. Alternative is a passive message. Plan takes the button.
8. **The folder root stays per window** (#28), while filters and recents are app-wide (D7). Opening a folder in window A does not change window B. This is the amendment's reading, but it produces a mixed model, so it is worth an explicit yes.
9. **This epic does not fix #34.** D7 keeps *new* preference state out of the stale-cache pattern by using a single shared observable, which is one of the two fixes #34 proposes — but it deliberately does not retrofit `sectionOrder`/`sectionExpanded`, because #34 says the app-wide-vs-per-window product question has to be answered first. **Confirm that split**, or fold the retrofit in here now that a working pattern exists next to it.
10. **`FileDocument.saveAs(_:)` keeps its stale `id`** (D12). It has the same problem `renamed(to:)` fixes, but changing it moves the `RecoveryBuffer` key for untitled documents mid-session, which is a session-restore concern that deserves its own change rather than a ride-along. Flagged, not fixed.
11. **Delete of an open clean document closes its window with no alert** (D11). Acceptance says "offers close/discard flow"; for a clean document there is nothing to discard and the alert would be OK-only. Confirm the reading, or add the confirm for symmetry.

## 11. Hand-off notes / known pitfalls (condensed — mirrored to the PR inline comment)

- **Normalize URLs in exactly one place** (`DirectoryEntry.init`) and **never resolve symlinks** (D4). `file:///a/b` and `file:///a/b/` are different `Hashable` keys, and a directory keyed both ways can be expanded and collapsed simultaneously. `standardizedFileURL` yes; `resolvingSymlinksInPath` no — it moves a symlinked folder's children under the target and breaks the parent→child relation the tree is built from.
- **`close(fd)` goes in the `DispatchSource` cancel handler and nowhere else** (D5). Closing before cancellation completes is a use-after-close on a descriptor number the process can immediately reuse.
- **`DirectoryWatcher` must not be `@MainActor`** (D5). A nonisolated `deinit` *can* read isolated stored properties (this was verified — don't repeat the folklore that it can't), but it **cannot call an isolated method**, so the moment you factor cancellation into a `cancel()` helper on a main-actor type, `deinit { cancel() }` stops compiling and the workaround (`Task { @MainActor in … }`) resurrects `self` and never runs. Keep the fd-owning type non-isolated.
- **A filesystem event carries no payload: re-list, diff, apply** (D6). And the diff is not an optimization — MacDown's own atomic save fires the watcher several times per save on a directory whose listing never changed. Without the diff, typing re-renders the tree.
- **Re-list off the main actor.** A 10 000-entry `contentsOfDirectory` on the main actor drops frames. Hop back to apply.
- **Use the batched `contentsOfDirectory(at:includingPropertiesForKeys:options:)`** with all four resource keys (§4.3). Per-URL `resourceValues` afterwards is 40 000 extra stats on a 10k folder and misses the budget on its own.
- **Measure `localizedStandardCompare` on 10 000 names before building on it** (§4.7). It is the single most likely reason the 200 ms budget fails, and the wrong fix (plain `<`) is a visible Finder-order regression.
- **`rows` is stored, not computed** (D15). E08 computes `visibleRows` in `body`; that is fine for an outline and quadratic for a folder.
- **Compare sibling names case-insensitively and exclude the item's own name** (D10). APFS is case-insensitive by default, and `notes.md` → `Notes.md` is a legal rename a naive check rejects.
- **Subtree containment is a path-component check, not a string prefix** (D10). `/a/foobar` is not inside `/a/foo`.
- **`FileManager.trashItem`, never `removeItem`** (D10). "Delete to Trash" is the acceptance wording and the recoverable behavior users expect.
- **Renaming re-keys `expanded`, `children` **and** `watchers` for the node and every cached descendant** (D10), or an expanded folder silently collapses when renamed and leaks its watcher.
- **`renamed(to:)` must recompute `format`, not just `fileURL`** (D12). Without it, `notes.md` → `notes.txt` stays Markdown-highlighted, Markdown-previewed, and outlined.
- **Do not bump `WorkspaceSession.currentVersion`** (D13). `loadSession()` discards any session whose version does not match — bumping it deletes every existing user's open tabs. An added optional `Codable` field needs no bump.
- **Do create `.withSecurityScope` bookmarks** (D14) — they work unsandboxed (verified), so sandboxing later is an entitlement change rather than a format migration. But **never call `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` when `start…` returned `false`**: the calls are reference-counted and an unbalanced stop revokes access someone else is holding.
- **One `FileTreePreferences` per process, injected** (D7). A per-window cached copy is exactly the bug already filed as #34; do not add four more instances of it.
- **`SidebarSelection` is app-target-only** (D8). If you write `import OutlineUI` inside `FileTree`, or `import FileTree` inside `OutlineUI`, stop.
- **Copy E08's row-gesture treatment verbatim** — `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` + `.contentShape(Rectangle())` + `.simultaneousGesture(TapGesture())`. Its comments in `SidebarView.swift` record why a plain `.onTapGesture` in a `List` row intermittently does nothing at all.
- **`FileTree` imports `FileCore`, `Foundation`, `Observation`, `Dispatch` — nothing else** (D1). No `SwiftUI`, no `AppKit`, no `Workspace`.
- **The watcher never touches an open document** (D11/§2.6). In-app CRUD does. External changes to open documents are E18's, and E18 must not have to depend on this module.
- **No `Package.swift` / `project.yml` / `ci.yml` diff** (§6). The target, the product, the test target, and the app dependency all already exist.
