# Third-party licence and provenance gate

**Owner summary.** MostlyText ships under MIT, but it also ships about 30
third-party components: parsers, a Markdown library, diagram engines compiled
to JavaScript and WebAssembly, math fonts, and colour themes. Each keeps its
own licence, and some licences (Graphviz's EPL-2.0, D2's MPL-2.0) also require
the source to be available. This directory is the release gate for those
obligations (#148, LC-01 to LC-09):

- `inventory.json` lists every third-party component the app ships, where it
  came from (exact upstream revision), its licence and the files it owns.
- `tools/compliance.py` checks that list against the source tree, generates
  the notices file and a software bill of materials (SBOM), and, at release
  time, refuses to pass while anything is pending or unverified.
- `generated/` holds the generated `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and
  `sbom.cdx.json`. The About → Open Source Licences screen (LC-08) will show
  the notices file, so no one maintains a second hand-written copy.

Why this way: the notices have to match what actually ships, byte for byte.
A single machine-checked inventory catches a new library, a changed file or a
deleted licence text in CI, instead of in a manual audit before release.

Risks and limits: this is evidence gathering, not legal advice, and no legal
clearance is claimed. Three things can't be proved from this repository
alone: the exact SwiftPM revisions (they come from the LC-05 lock file, which
another task owns), the runtime resources inside the final signed app (checked
on a Mac with `--artifact`; compiled code can't be checked this way, see below),
and public source availability (checked when LC-09 hosting
exists). Those stay **unverified**, never passed, until they are checked.

Non-goals: this doesn't change the app, its dependencies or the lock file,
and it doesn't publish anything.

## Commands

Run from the repository root. They need only Python 3.11 or later.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Check the inventory against the tree | `python3 compliance/tools/compliance.py check` |
| Show everything still blocking public 1.0 | `python3 compliance/tools/compliance.py check --release` |
| Check a built app or mounted DMG (Mac; the signing script runs this) | `python3 compliance/tools/compliance.py check --release --artifact /path/MostlyText.app` |
| Regenerate the notices file | `python3 compliance/tools/compliance.py notices` |
| Regenerate the SBOM | `python3 compliance/tools/compliance.py sbom` |
| Run the tool's own tests | `python3 -m unittest discover -s compliance/tests` |

The `Compliance` workflow runs the tests and the tree check on every pull
request and push to `master`. It also prints the release ledger for
information; that step is expected to fail until the release candidate
exists. The strict version runs in the signing script's
`--release-candidate` mode, against the built app.

## What the check rejects

| Rule | Tree check | `--release` |
|---|---|---|
| A file under `MacDown2/` that is neither first-party nor owned by a component | fail | fail |
| A file inside a component's wildcard-owned boundary (such as a vendored package's `**`) that isn't in that component's audited `files`, licence texts or runtime resources. `owns` says which component a file belongs to; it doesn't make the file compliant, and such a file can't pass as first-party | fail | fail |
| A `project.yml` package requirement (`exactVersion`, `from`, `minorVersion`, `branch`, `revision`…) that differs from the inventory, or a `packages:` entry the checker can't read (it fails closed) | fail | fail |
| A SwiftPM dependency not in the inventory, in any `Package.swift` under `MacDown2/` (found automatically) or in `project.yml`'s `packages:` | fail | fail |
| A local package that no component owns, or an XcodeGen local package outside `MacDown2/` | fail | fail |
| A `.package(...)` declaration the checker can't read, such as a registry `id:` or an interpolated URL (it fails closed) | fail | fail |
| A manifest requirement that differs from the inventory (stale mapping) | fail | fail |
| A missing or edited licence/notice text, or a vendored file whose digest changed | fail | fail |
| A runtime resource whose recorded digest no longer matches its source file, or a vendored bundle with no runtime resources declared | fail | fail |
| A copyleft component with no source location recorded | fail | fail |
| Generated notices or SBOM out of date with the inventory | fail | fail |
| No lock file, an unregistered resolved package, or a resolved revision that differs from the inventory | unverified until `lockfile_enforced` is `true` | fail |
| A component still `pending`, or with open items | allowed | fail |
| A source location not yet verified by anonymous download | allowed | fail |

Manifests are read by a small comment-aware scanner, not a Swift parser. It
handles single-line and multi-line `.package(...)` declarations, ignores
commented-out ones, and extracts `exact:`, `from:`, `branch:` and `revision:`
requirements, noting `.upToNextMinor/Major`. A range requirement (`"1.0"..<"2.0"`)
is kept verbatim so it can't silently match a recorded one.

## What `--artifact` proves about a built app

The inventory separates two records:
- **`files`** is provenance: the source-tree files a component owns, with
  their digests.
- **`runtime_resources`** is the must-ship contract: files that must appear
  in the built `.app`, identified by name and SHA-256.

With `--artifact`, the check fails if any of these is true:

1. A runtime resource is missing from the app, or its bytes differ. The
   resources are the Mermaid, Viz.js and D2 engines, both themes, every
   tree-sitter query file that ships (the vendored grammars' files, plus the
   `queries/` folders that the remote grammar packages copy into the app,
   matched against their upstream digests), and all 12 SwiftUIMath fonts,
   also matched against their upstream digests.
2. The app doesn't contain this repository's `LICENSE` and generated
   `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, byte for byte.
3. The app ships a script, WebAssembly, font or tree-sitter query (`.scm`) file (the extensions listed in
   `inventory.json` → `artifact.registered_extensions`) whose digest isn't a
   known runtime resource or a first-party source file.

It does **not** prove anything about compiled code. Swift packages and the C
grammar parsers are linked into the binary and can't be matched by digest.
For those, the evidence is the source-tree check, the exact revisions in the
SBOM and, once LC-05 lands, the lock file. Data files that dependencies
copy in with extensions outside that list (for example SwiftUIMath's font
`.plist` metrics) are covered by the notices but aren't matched individually.

The Compliance workflow runs on every pull request and every push to
`master`, with no path filter. A test (`test_compliance_workflow_cannot_be_skipped_by_path_filters`)
fails if anyone narrows it.

The tests in `tests/test_compliance.py` break a passing fixture one way at a
time and assert that each break fails, including:
- an unregistered multi-line dependency;
- an unowned local package;
- a new nested manifest;
- an XcodeGen package;
- a missing or modified runtime resource;
- a stray font in the app;
- missing or stale notices;
- stale digests and mappings.

`tests/test_release_script.py` runs the signing script against stub Apple
tools. It proves that `--dry-run` records a failing licence gate or a missing
notarisation log as UNVERIFIED, and that `--release-candidate` stops on
either.

## When you change a dependency or bundled file

1. Update the component in `inventory.json`: version, full revision, digests,
   and the licence texts. Take licence texts verbatim from the upstream
   revision and put them in `licenses/` as `<component-id>--<FILE>.txt`,
   recording the upstream path, revision and SHA-256.
2. Run `notices` and `sbom`, then `check`.
3. Commit the inventory, the licence texts and `generated/` together.

**After the LC-05 lock file lands:** update each `pending-lockfile` component
to the locked revision, re-check its licence text at that revision, register
any additional resolved packages, and then set `"lockfile_enforced": true`.
From then on a lock-file change that isn't reflected here fails CI.

## Provenance findings (2026-09-28)

Method: compare the Git blob hash or SHA-256 of each shipped file with the
upstream history or the published npm tarball. Nothing below was inferred from
file names or comments alone.

| Item | LC | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| TreeSitterMarkdown (vendored) | LC-04 | Every parser, scanner, header and injection-query file is byte-identical to `tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-markdown` **v0.5.3** (`f969cd3`). MIT, © 2021 Matthias Deiml. The package had no licence file: `LICENSE` is now copied verbatim from that tag, and `README.md` records the evidence. The two `highlights.scm` files are local rewrites for this app's capture names. Upstream says those queries came from nvim-treesitter, so its Apache-2.0 notice is carried as well, conservatively. |
| TreeSitterJavaScript (vendored) | LC-01 | Byte-identical to `tree-sitter-javascript` **v0.25.0** (`44c892e`). No local changes. |
| TreeSitterSQL (vendored) | LC-01 | Byte-identical to upstream's generated-source deploy `851e9cb` (`gh-pages`), built from `main` `3c99273` (after v0.3.11). No local changes. The package README that `Package.swift` referred to didn't exist; it does now. |
| Tomorrow Dark theme | LC-06 | Chris Kempson's Tomorrow **Night Eighties** palette (MIT), by way of MacDown's legacy `Tomorrow.style` (MIT), including MacDown's `#888888` comment colour. Attribution added for both. |
| "Tomorrow Light" theme | LC-06 | **Not derived from Tomorrow.** Its seven token colours all come from GitHub's `github-syntax-light` v0.4.1 palette (MIT, © 2016 GitHub, Inc.); the text, caret and selection colours are local choices. The licence is fine and attribution is added. The misleading name belongs to E23 (#113), which owns theme integration and will decide whether to rename or re-source the theme. |
| Mermaid, Viz.js | LC-01, LC-02 | `mermaid.min.js` and `viz-global.js` are byte-identical to the npm releases mermaid@11.17.2 and @viz-js/viz@3.30.0. The viz bundle reports Graphviz 16.0.0. |
| D2 | LC-03 | Identical to npm @terrastruct/d2@0.1.33 except the one documented export statement. The existing `NOTICE.txt` is accurate. |
| SwiftUIMath fonts | LC-01 | New finding: SwiftUIMath ships 12 OpenType math fonts under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 and the GUST Font License. Their licence texts and each font's own copyright line (read from its `name` table) are now in the notices. |
| libyaml in Yams | LC-01 | New finding: Yams ships libyaml's C sources without libyaml's licence file. The libyaml MIT notice is added. |

Open items per component are listed in `inventory.json` and by
`check --release`. The main ones: exact SwiftPM revisions (waiting on LC-05),
Mermaid's bundled npm dependencies, the Graphviz and D2 corresponding-source
packages (LC-02, LC-03 and LC-09), and confirming the font set in the signed
app.
